# Gender Classification Using Machine Learning

This repository contains a gender classification project that uses machine learning techniques to predict a person's gender based on specific features.

## Project Overview

Gender classification is a fundamental task in data science applications such as personalized marketing, demographics analysis, and more. This project explores the use of supervised learning algorithms to classify gender based on available data features.

## Dataset

- **Dataset Source**: [Add your dataset source, e.g., Kaggle or UCI Repository]
- **Features**: Include details about relevant features (e.g., height, weight, voice pitch, etc.).
- **Target**: Two classes - Male and Female.

## Libraries Used

- **Python**
- **NumPy**
- **Pandas**
- **scikit-learn**: for model training, evaluation, and tuning
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn**: for visualizations

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handled missing values, if any.
   - Standardized or normalized features for better model performance.
   - Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights.

2. **Model Training**
   - Trained multiple algorithms, including:
     - Logistic Regression
     - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
     - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
     - Decision Trees
   - Selected the best model based on accuracy and other performance metrics.

3. **Evaluation**
   - Assessed models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
   - Visualized performance with confusion matrices.

4. **Hyperparameter Tuning**
   - Applied techniques like GridSearchCV to optimize model parameters.

## Results

The model with the highest accuracy was selected, achieving an accuracy of **XX%** (update with actual results) in gender classification.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/gender-classification.git
   ```
2. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the main script to classify gender:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Conclusion

This project illustrates the application of machine learning in gender classification. Future improvements could involve additional features or more complex algorithms for improved accuracy.
